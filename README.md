# QDamakuEngine

## What is this

This is just a Damaku Engine write in pyQt

## Why create this project

The original goal is developing a Damaku Notification Software, but I find it is hard to access notification detail on Windows. So I turn to wirte this and maybe I will know how to get notification detail in the future.

## How to use

Start this script and it will listen on address and port which you have set in setting dialog. The default setting is 127.0.0.1:2333. Then, send information to that port and address and finally, data will be shown on screen as a danmaku.
